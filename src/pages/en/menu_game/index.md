## Game List

The newer games are at the top.  
It would be great if you could play the games with high "Interestingness" scores first.  
**All games are freeware (free)**, so please download them as much as you like!

※ If the game is slow or has some kind of problem, please try running it with "ScreenType=1" in the "Setting.ini" environment setting file. This may improve the situation (some games do not have "Setting.ini").

※ If the gamepad (game controller) does not work, you may be able to solve the problem by following the instructions [here](/en/menu_support/gamepad_preferred_device/).

What is the Tough Enemy Series?

The Tough Enemy Series has the following features:

- You can play as many times as you want with the data after clearing the game.
- You can rest assured that there are no rare items that you will not be able to obtain later.
- The towns are small and there are almost no errand events, so you don't have to do troublesome searches.
- The bosses are strong, as are the regular enemies, so there are many battles where you can't let your guard down.
- But even if you are wiped out, you only lose 20% of your money, so you can feel free to challenge them.

| Latest Version Release Date | 2018/4/14 |
| Comments | This is a battle-focused SRPG created with the [Simulation RPG Editor](/en/menu_game/SRPGEditor/index.html).  <br>The growth system employs random growth & random skill acquisition, as in the previous game.  <br>You can see the enemy's battle AI on the map, so the simulation aspect is slightly stronger than the previous game. (← This is very important)  <br>However, there isn't too much information required for攻略, so I would recommend it even to those who are not good at simulation games.  <br>You can also play multiple times. |

| Comments | In plain terms, this is a "block breaker that can be aimed".  <br>Unfortunately, there is a pretty bad bug, but since it's a very old and dirty program, I couldn't remove it. (I don't feel like remaking it)  <br>Only "Baseball Mode" is recommended.  <br>  <br>**※VB6.0 runtime required**  <br>The VB6.0 runtime can be downloaded from [Vector](http://www.vector.co.jp/vpack/filearea/win95/util/runtime/index.html), etc.  <br>It may already be installed, so try playing the game first and get it if you can't. |

| Comments | Tough Enemy Series #2!  <br>Unbelievably! All the small fry characters become your friends!  <br>It's several levels more powerful than 1, but the concept (enemies are strong, but you get 80% of your money back when you're wiped out, etc.) is the same.  <br>I think you can clear the first周目 in about 10-15 hours. |
