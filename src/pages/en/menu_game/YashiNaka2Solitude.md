## Simulation RPG YashiNaka2 Solitude (Free)

Here, you can download the simulation RPG "YashiNaka2 Solitude" for free.  
It's an arranged version of "Yashiyu and Friends 2", but you can enjoy it even without playing the original.  
In "YashiNaka2 Solitude", only one character can participate in a stage, but in return, you can learn many skills and re-act after defeating enemies, providing a good range of tactics.  
  
This game is also a sample game for the Simulation RPG Editor.  
The Simulation RPG Editor itself (the editor program) is included with this game, but it may not be the latest version. (It is the latest version that the author confirmed works with "YashiNaka2 Solitude.")
