## Simulation RPG Simulayu (Free)

Here, you can download the simulation RPG "Simulayu" for free.  

The **battle system is similar to Nintendo's Fire Emblem**, with a rock-paper-scissors-like strength/weakness relationship: Sword/Light → Axe/Dark → Spear/Fire → Sword/Light → ...  
If the compatibility is good, accuracy and evasion rates increase.  

It offers replayability due to random elements in character stats, learned skills, and shop inventory.  
Also, **after clearing the game, you can play through any number of times with the same data.**  
Although there are many random elements, **you can raise any number of characters, and there are no irreversible elements, so you can play with peace of mind.** ← This is a commitment.  

This game is also a sample game for "Simulation RPG Editor 2".  
*The "Simulation RPG Editor 2" main program (editor program) is also included, but it may not be the latest version. (It is the latest version that the author confirmed works with "Simulayu.")  
In "Simulation RPG Editor 2", you can choose between two battle systems: "Auto Battle" and "Manual Battle", but **Simulayu adopts "Auto Battle"**.  

Note that there is no sample game for "Manual Battle".  
If you prefer, there is "Yashiyu and Friends 2", a sample game from "Simulation RPG Editor", the predecessor to "Simulation RPG Editor 2".  
Since "Manual Battle" has not undergone significant changes from the previous work (limited to the battle system), playing "Yashiyu and Friends 2" to quickly and deeply understand "Manual Battle" is a valid approach. [To "Yashiyu and Friends 2" Download](/en/menu_game/#NAKAMA2)
