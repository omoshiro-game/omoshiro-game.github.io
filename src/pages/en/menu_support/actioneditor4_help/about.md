## About This Help

This is the online help for Action Editor 4.  
  
● Differentiating Highlight Colors  
**・Orange** ... Important sections.  
**・Red** ... Important sections. Denotes caution or prohibition.  
**・Green** ... Not extremely important, but intuitively hard to understand sections.  
  
Even important sections may not be highlighted if they are already explained within the editor.  
Also, highlights are deliberately not used in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section.  
  
● About Screenshots  
Screenshots were taken with version 2.61β or 5.13β.  
They may differ from the latest version's screen.
