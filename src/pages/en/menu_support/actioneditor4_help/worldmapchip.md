Clicking the left mouse button on the map allows you to place map chips.  
The placed map chip will be the one selected in the map chip palette.  
  
**Right-clicking (dragging also possible) on the map allows you to memorize the map chip at the cursor position.** (This is the eyedropper function.)  
  
Settings for each map chip, such as passability, are configured in the database "World Chip."
