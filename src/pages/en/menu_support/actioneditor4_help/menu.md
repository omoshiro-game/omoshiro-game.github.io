○ Path to stage file to copy (Template)  
This determines the initial state of the stage, excluding the stage palette.  
Whether you input the version part of the extension or not, the latest version will be read, so it's fine to use ".stg4_***" or ".stg4_", etc.  
  
○ Stage Palette  
Initial state of the stage palette.  
  
● Open Stage  
Loads a stage from an existing stage file (.stg4_*).  
**You can load old version stage files, but you cannot load stage files with a newer version than the editor.**  
By the way, you can identify the stage file version by its extension. (The "*" part of the filename "~.stg_*" represents the version).  
  
● Close Stage  
Closes the currently edited stage.  
  
● Overwrite Save Common Palette & Overwrite Save Stage  
Overwrites and saves the common palette and the currently edited stage.  
**If the editor version differs between the previous save and the current one, it will always be a new save.**  
**At this time, the old version of the stage file will be automatically backed up to the "data" > "stg4" > "old_ver" folder. (You can also prevent backup in the "Project" > "Project Options" settings.)**  
  
● Overwrite Save Common Palette & New Save Stage  
Overwrites and saves the common palette, then saves the currently edited stage as a new file.  
  
● Overwrite Save Common Palette  
Overwrites and saves the common palette.
