## Title screen and options

Title screen

![Title screen](/menu_support/srpgeditor2_help/game_title/title.jpg)

After the game launches, the title screen is displayed first.  

The menu displayed at the bottom of the screen is explained below.  

● Start New Game  
Starts a new game from the beginning.  

● Continue  
Loads save data saved in the menu "Save" and continues the game.  
**If there's a lot of save data, displaying the save data list might take time.**  
**How to delete save data is written in "Readme.txt" (manual).**  

● Options  
Here, you can configure game environmental settings.  
・"Gamepad" ... If using a gamepad, set to "ON"; otherwise, set to "OFF". However, **strictly speaking, this setting determines whether to detect gamepad connection during play, and even if "OFF", the gamepad will be recognized if connected before game launch. Conversely, if "ON" is selected when not using a gamepad, connection detection will be performed at regular intervals only when disconnected, causing the game's execution speed (FPS) to become unstable. That said, connection detection is not performed during action scenes where stable speed is crucial, so there's no need to be overly concerned.**  
・"BGM" ... Presence or absence of music.  
・"SE" ... Sound effect volume.
