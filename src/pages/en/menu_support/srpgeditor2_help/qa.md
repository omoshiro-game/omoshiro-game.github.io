## Q. The program (.exe) won't start!

A. The following possibilities are considered:  

・Missing required files for launch  
If dll files or folders like "data" and "image" and their contents are deleted or renamed, the program may not be able to launch.  

・Security software is interfering  
You need to allow Simulation RPG Editor 2 to launch.  
The settings method varies depending on the security software.  

・DirectX 9.0c or later is not installed  
Please update DirectX using [DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/download/details.aspx?id=35).  
However, for modern PCs (as of June 2019), DirectX updates are usually not necessary.  

・Abnormal termination occurred in the previous play  
If the game program (including test play) terminated abnormally (crashed) in the previous execution, the next launch may be regarded as a duplicate launch and fail.  
For test play, restarting the editor or terminating the process from Task Manager (deleting "Game_v*.exe" in the "Processes" tab) may fix it.  
Alternatively, restart your OS.  

If it still doesn't launch, please provide a report file on the BBS along with a clear description of the symptoms (including error message content if any) and ask your question.  
A report file is a file generated in the same folder as the program itself when Simulation RPG Editor 2 launches, and it contains PC specifications, error information, and more.

## Q. How do I change the program (.exe) icon?

A. Simulation RPG Editor 2 itself does not have an icon changing function, but you can change the icon using an icon changing software.  
For example, there is software like this:  
  
Software Name: IconReset  
Author: Aru-sama  
URL: [https://softaro.net/File/IconReset.html](https://softaro.net/File/IconReset.html)  
  
With IconReset, you can also change the icons in the title bar and taskbar.  
To briefly describe the procedure: Launch IconReset → Specify the program file (.exe) by opening it (or drag and drop) → Double-click the icon displayed in IconReset → Specify the icon file (.ico).  
Regarding icon files (.ico), you can create them with dot-picture oriented graphics tools like [EDGE2](http://takabosoft.com/edge2/) or its predecessor [EDGE](http://takabosoft.com/edge/). (The creation method is to "Save As" and select "ICO - Icon" as the "File Type").  
Creating icon files with "EDGE2" requires user registration (paid).

A. No, you can't. Sorry.  
You cannot attack from more than 2 squares away on the stage map, nor can you attack multiple enemies in one action.

## Q. Can I play mp3 files as BGM?

A. Unfortunately, mp3 format is not supported.  
However, it supports OggVorbis (.ogg) format, so you can convert mp3 to ogg using software like CDex and use it.  
  
For details on OggVorbis (.ogg), please refer to the "Ogg Village" website below.  
[http://oggvorbis.fc2web.com/](http://oggvorbis.fc2web.com/)  
  
For downloading and Japanese localization of CDex, please refer to the following:

CDex Japanese Localization: [http://homepage2.nifty.com/moto-h/hissori.html](http://homepage2.nifty.com/moto-h/hissori.html)  
↑ Download "CDex v1.70β3 Hissori Rel-2.10" etc., and then follow "Readme.txt".
