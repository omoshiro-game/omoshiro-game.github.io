## Overview

The event action palette is a template for event actions.  
(Since "event action palette" is long, it will be referred to as "action palette" below).  
In the action palette, you can register one or more configured actions as favorites and call them up at any time.  
For example, you can register a "Message" with display position and picture simultaneously displayed as a template for a message with a character portrait.
