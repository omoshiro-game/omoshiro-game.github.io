## How to Delete Default Edit Data

In the editor, databases and palette data are pre-created as default data.  
If you want to delete default data, in the previous work, you could do so by deleting all or some files in the "data" folder, but in this work, I cannot guarantee operation.  
Deletion itself is possible, but subsequent behavior has not even been tested.  
**If you want to delete all data in databases like "Class" or event palette data, please set the "Data Count" button in each respective data editing window to "1".**  
This will delete all data except the first one.
