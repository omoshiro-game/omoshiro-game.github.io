## Overview

Picture is a function that displays arbitrary image files in events on the stage map.  
You specify image files in Database "Picture", and display them using the event action "Picture".  

**Picture image files are located in the "picture" folder within the "image" folder. (There are only a few.)  
If you want to add new picture image files, please put them in this folder as well.**  

Note that picture images are loaded when the event action "Picture" is executed.
