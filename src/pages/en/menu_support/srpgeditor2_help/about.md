## About This Help

This is the online help for Simulation RPG Editor 2.  
I apologize, but there are no tutorial-like explanations that you can naturally learn by following the steps.  
I considered it, but it was too much trouble and I gave up...  

If you want to learn efficiently, please try playing the sample game [Simulayu](/en/menu_game/Simulayu/).  
I think you'll be able to grasp the game system to some extent with that.  
However, "Simulayu" uses "Auto Battle" mode, so you cannot experience the other battle mode, "Manual Battle".  

After playing the sample game, I recommend either diligently reading through this help from top to bottom, focusing on the highlighted sections, while experimenting with the editor and game, or starting to edit with a trial-and-error approach and then looking things up in the help when you encounter something you don't understand.  
As the author of this software lacks patience, I prefer the latter (lol).  
In either case, after you've gotten used to editing, reading the help again from the beginning, even just the highlighted parts, might lead to new discoveries.  

● About Highlight Colors  
**・Orange** ... Important sections.  
**・Red** ... Important sections. Denotes caution or prohibition.  
**・Green** ... Not extremely important, but intuitively hard to understand sections.  
  
Even important sections may not be highlighted if they are already explained within the editor.  
Also, highlights are deliberately not used in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section.  

● About Screenshots  
Screenshots were taken with version 2.70β.  
They may differ from the latest version's screen.  

● About potentially misleading expressions, Part 1: "Equip" and "Learn"  
For a certain reason, the usage of "Equip" and "Learn" in this help is unique.  
Changing the skills used in auto-battle, or the skills themselves, is written as "equip (to equip)".  
In contrast, setting a skill's "type" to "Weapon" or "Armor" allows creating skills that increase stats just by being learned, but in this help, I have tried to avoid expressions like "equip (weapon or armor type skills)" and instead unified it to "learn (weapon or armor skills)".  
For example, **"equipped skills" does not refer to weapon or armor type skills, but to skills used in auto-battle.**  
I apologize if this makes the explanations harder to read or creates misunderstandings.  

● About potentially misleading expressions, Part 2: "Event Actions" and "Commands"  
There's one more (sweat).  
**The content of events like "Message" and "Status Manipulation" is called "event actions", or their abbreviated form "actions".**  
These are called "commands" in Action Editor 4, but for the author of this software, "commands" in RPGs sometimes bring to mind menu commands, and since it was originally "event actions" from the previous work, it's hard to change it now. Therefore, in this work, it's "event actions".  
Also, "command" in this help mostly refers to menu commands.  
It might be confusing if you have experience with Action Editor 4, but please get used to it...
