## Position Group Settings

**A position group is a set of multiple coordinates (X, Y) used to specify ally initial positions, enemy destinations, and so on.**

Clicking on the stage map will change the color of the clicked square, setting it as a position group.  
To undo, simply click again.  
You can set any number of squares.  

Explanation of each setting item.  

● Position Group Name  
The name of the position group.  
**It will not be displayed in the game.**  

● Center Coordinates  
**If a position group is specified as an ally's initial position, the map cursor will be set to center the screen on these center coordinates before the stage starts.**  
**Similarly, when a position group is specified for "Target to align cursor" in victory condition explanations or for event action "Move Map Cursor", the map cursor will also be set to center the screen on these center coordinates.**
