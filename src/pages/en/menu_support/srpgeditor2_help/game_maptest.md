During stage play, you can **call up the test menu by pressing the F key on the stage map.**  
The test menu mostly consists of menu commands for test play, such as freely manipulating variables, but **only the retry function can be used even when not in test play.**  

Each command is explained below.  

● Retry this stage  
Retries the currently played stage.  
Both enemies and allies revert to their state before the stage began.  
This is the only command that can be selected even when not in test play.  

● Clear this stage  
Clears the currently played stage.  

● Turn Skip  
Advances all at once to the specified turn.  
Useful for testing events with turn count conditions.  

● Check Common Variables  
You can check the values of all common variables.  
Furthermore, **pressing the Z key allows you to freely manipulate the value of any variable.** Use the arrow keys (↑↓←→) to increase or decrease the value.  
Pressing the C key will undo all value manipulations performed this time.  

● Exit Game  
Exits the game and returns to the title screen.
