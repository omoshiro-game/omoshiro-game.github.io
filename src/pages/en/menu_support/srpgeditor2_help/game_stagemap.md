## Stage Play

The stage map screen is where the stage takes place.  

On the stage map, ally (player) turns and enemy (computer) turns alternate.  
Each character can move and act once per turn.  
**After completing necessary actions, press the Z key on an empty square to call up the system menu, then select "End Turn" to advance the turn. (In some settings, the turn automatically ends when all characters have acted.)**  
Enemies act according to their set movement AI.  

By repeatedly moving, acting, and battling, and fulfilling the victory conditions set for each stage, the stage is cleared.  
After clearing the stage, you earn rewards (e.g., gold).  
Conversely, fulfilling the defeat conditions results in game over, and you are returned to the title screen.

## Understanding the Stage Map Screen

Stage Map Screen

● Character  
(For default images) Blue characters are allies, red characters are enemies.  

The bar displayed above the character is their current HP.  
**You can toggle HP bar display/hide with the D key.**  

**The symbol displayed in the bottom right of the character indicates their compatibility type.**  
In games where classes and skills have compatibility ("Compatibility Type"), this symbol is important.  
**You can toggle the display/hide of this symbol with the S key.**  

Hovering the map cursor (blue square cursor) over a character displays a status window at the top of the screen. **For enemies, an enemy description (e.g., combat action patterns) is displayed below the status window.**  
Furthermore, pressing the confirm key while the cursor is over an ally allows you to execute character movement and actions (commands).  

> For details on ally movement and actions, refer to ["Ally Character Movement and Actions"](../game_action/).  

● Terrain Information  
At the bottom of the screen, the movement cost (required movement points) and terrain effects during combat for the terrain at the map cursor's position are displayed.  
**Terrain effects apply to both enemies and allies.**  
**You can toggle the display/hide of the terrain information window with the A key.**
