To switch, select "Edit" -> "Change Palette" -> "Map Chip" from the menu at the top of the world map window, or press the space key.  
Then the following window will appear.

To place map chips, click and select the map chip you want from the map chip palette.  
Then click on the world map to place the map chip.  

**Right-clicking (dragging also possible) on the world map allows you to memorize the map chip at the cursor position.** (This is the eyedropper function).  

Settings for the map chip itself, such as passability, are done in [Database "World Chip"](../db_worldchip/).
