When transitioning from the world map to the stage map, this preparation menu is called up first (an event may occur before it, depending on the stage).  
Here, you can check the stage map and rules, and place allies.  

Each command is explained below.  

● Place  
Places ally characters on the stage.  
Characters can **only be placed on blinking squares.**  
Also, the leader must always be placed.  

● Change Position  
Swaps positions between placed ally characters.  

● Cancel  
Cancels the participation of placed ally characters.  

● Map  
You can view stats by hovering the cursor over ally characters or enemy characters, and pressing the Z key also displays learned skills.  
This is mainly useful when you want to see enemy stats.  

● Rules  
You can confirm the rules of this stage, such as victory conditions and defeat conditions.  
Align the cursor with any condition and press the Z key to display targets and position information related to that condition.  

● Start Play  
Starts stage play.  
Cannot be started without placing a leader.  

● Turn Back  
Returns to the world map.
