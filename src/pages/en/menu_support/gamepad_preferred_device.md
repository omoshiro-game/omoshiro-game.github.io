## When the Gamepad Doesn't Work

All games and game creation software published on this site, excluding browser games, support gamepads (game controllers).  
However, since only the highest priority gamepad (usually the one Windows recognizes first) can be used, if your desired **gamepad doesn't work, you need to raise its priority by setting it as the "Preferred Device" in the Control Panel** (this is not necessary for "Action Editor 4" version 9.60 and later, and "Simulation RPG Editor 2" version 5.00 and later).  

For detailed instructions on how to set "Preferred Device," please refer to [this link](https://blog.janjan.net/2018/06/04/windows10-disabled-xbox-controller/). Although the link is for Windows 10, I believe it's largely the same for Windows 8 and Windows 7.  
I haven't confirmed for Vista or XP, but the concept of priority existed back then, so it seems likely it can be resolved through the Control Panel as well.  

*Of course, this assumes that the gamepad is recognized by Windows.  
*Some types might still not work even after setting "Preferred Device", but this will be considered a specification.  

For older games, it's not uncommon for only the highest priority gamepad to work, and solutions can be found by searching. However, I feel that the "Preferred Device" setting is not widely known these days. What do you think?  

"Action Editor 4" version 9.60 and "Simulation RPG Editor 2" version 5.00 no longer require priority settings, but I apologize for the inconvenience caused, especially to AcEdi and SimuEdi users. I am truly sorry.
