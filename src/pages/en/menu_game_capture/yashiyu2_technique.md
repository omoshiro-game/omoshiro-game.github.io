## "Legend of Yashiyu 2" Formulas & Techniques, etc.

I was quite hesitant about creating this page, but since there was a request for it, I did.  
I feel like you might enjoy the game more if you don't look at this... (though I personally like looking at techniques).

## Formulas

Frankly, these are the formulas.  
  
● Weapon Attack Damage (Normal Attacks or attack skills written in Hiragana)  
Damage = (Skill's Attack Power + Your "Attack" - Opponent's "Defense" ÷ 2) × (1.0~1.2)  
　　*For normal attacks, "Skill's Attack Power" should be set to 0.  
  
● Magic Attack Skill Damage (Attack skills written in Katakana, like "Napalm")  
Damage = (Skill's Attack Power + Your "Magic" × 0.8 - Opponent's "Resistance" ÷ 2) × (1.0~1.2)  
  
● Healing Skill Recovery Amount  
Recovery Amount = (Skill's Power + Your "Magic" ÷ 3) × (1.0~1.2)  
  
● Support Skill Effect Amount  
Effect Amount = (Skill's Power + Your "Magic" ÷ 4) × (1.0~1.2)  
　　*However, skills related to "Reaction", "Spirit", "Accuracy", and "Break" are not affected by "Magic".  
  
● "Spirit" Related Recovery Amount  
HP Recovery Amount when Time Cursor completes one cycle and when "Healing Drop" is active = Max HP × ("Spirit" ÷ 100)  
  
SP Recovery Amount at end of battle = Max SP × ("Spirit" ÷ 500)  
  
● Success Rate of "Escape" Command  
Success Rate (%) = Frontline "Reaction" average × 4 + Number of failed "Escape" attempts (in that battle) × 15  
  

## Recommended Skills

For now, HP recovery and area magic are useful. (However, area magic requires a certain level of "Magic".)  
Other useful skills are introduced below.  
  
● Cremation  
This is also area magic, but I'll specifically mention it because its added effect of "Sleep" is good.  
Of course, its purpose is for minion battles.  
  
● Refresh  
Recovers status ailments for all allies.  
In battles where status ailments are highly likely, such as against "Death God Plutoon" or "True Mountain Lord", it's better to rely on "Wind Barrier" instead.  
  
● Quick  
Increases one ally's "Reaction" by 2.  
Applying this to a healer in a boss battle increases stability.  
However, applying it too much is risky as it's lost upon death... Try to apply it to characters that don't die easily. (Applying Protect or Enhance is also good).  
I often applied it to Yashiyu.  
  
● Melty  
Lowers an enemy's "Defense".  
Combining this with "Earth's Guard" leads to interesting results.  
If you reduce the enemy's "Defense" to 0 with "Melty", then 0 × 2 = 0, meaning only the enemy doesn't benefit from "Earth's Guard".  
  
● Base  
Resets an opponent's abilities (excluding "HP" and "SP") to their state just before the battle.  
If a boss uses ability-boosting skills, cancel them with this.  
Honestly, Dark Yashiyu is to be pitied!  
  
● Mad Pulsar  
Inflicts various status ailments on one enemy.  
Actually, this skill is incredibly effective in Beat Up Mode. (It's also quite effective in minion battles).  
However, learning the skill takes a while...  
  
● Return  
Rewinds time by one-quarter.  
Doesn't let undead escape (lol).  
Combined with "Wandering Time", it's easy to keep it perpetually day (or night).  
  
● Earth's Guard  
A field where "Defense" doubles.  
Combining this with "Melty" leads to interesting results.  
If you reduce the enemy's "Defense" to 0 with "Melty", then 0 × 2 = 0, meaning only the enemy doesn't benefit.  
The field disappears when the time circle completes one rotation, but even considering that, it's very valuable.  
  
● Wind Barrier  
A field that prevents all status ailments.  
Useful in battles like "Death God Plutoon" and "True Mountain Lord".  
  
● Wandering Time  
A field that halves the speed of time progression.  
Useful in Beat Up Mode, and also in boss battles with high "Spirit" recovery.  
Combined with "Return", it's easy to keep it perpetually day (or night).  
  
  
Also, Enhance (for bosses), Decline (for bosses), etc., are useful.

## Recommended Allies

It's pretty arbitrary (lol).  
  
● First Half (Before acquiring Squid)  
・Healer  
Sort of a safe bet.  
Leveling them up to a certain point and then putting them in reserve makes dungeon crawling easier.  
  
・Birdmage  
"Reaction" 13 is significant.  
Has many useful skills like "Blaze", "Scarlet", "Melty", "Quick", "Heal Wind".  
However, prone to dying...  
  
・Treant  
The only one who can use "Earth's Guard" in the first half. (This skill's effectiveness varies with party compatibility...).  
Also, if you raise it to LV24, Yashiyu learns "Earth's Guard".  
It also learns healing skills, but its "SP", "Magic", and "Reaction" are low, making it a poor healer.  
  
・Healing Demon  
Learns "Heal Drop" and "Refresh" early, and has high "HP", so it doesn't die easily.  
It also has high attack power, making it useful in both offense and defense.  
But upon closer inspection, its "Magic" is low at 6 (lol).  
  
・Dragon Knight  
Threatening "HP" and a full set of support skills.  
Though "Magic" is low, it doesn't affect "Quick", "Base", or "Remove".  
  
● Second Half (After acquiring Squid)  
・Mocking Moon  
Area magic is very useful in minion battles.  
Can also use "Wind Barrier".  
  
・Super Healer  
A specialist in healing.  
Leveling them up to a certain point and then putting them in reserve makes dungeon crawling incredibly easy.  
However, "Reaction" is somewhat low at 9, so relying on this person too much for healing will likely lead to trouble.  
(Meaning, it's dangerous because without increasing their "Reaction" with "Quick" etc., the boss might attack twice before the Super Healer's turn comes.)  
  
・Strong-Armed Demon  
I was actually going to write "Powerful Whale", but upon closer inspection, I think this one is slightly better.  
Its "HP" and "Attack" are quite high.  
  
・Goodbye Man  
High "Attack", and surprisingly high "Resistance" (rare for this type).  
Can also use "Lapse" and "Quick".  
  
  
● Secret Dungeon  
・Pluto Hades  
Like "Mocking Moon", area magic is very useful in minion battles.  
  
・Shield Master  
Full elemental resistance, and outrageous "HP", "Defense", and "Resistance".  
Support skills like "Protect", "Enhance", and "Earth's Guard" are also reliable.  
  
● Summary  
Basically, characters with excellent "Attack" or "Magic" (and skills that utilize "Magic") are better than balanced types.  
For healers, "SP" and "Reaction" are also important... or so I'd like to say, but looking at the characters above, that's not the case (lol).  
Also, party balance is not taken into consideration.
