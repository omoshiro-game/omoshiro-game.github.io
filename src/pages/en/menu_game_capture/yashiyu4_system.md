## "Legend of Yashiyu 4" Mechanism for 2nd Playthrough and Beyond

When you clear the game, your data is carried over and you are returned to the beginning of the story. (However, your money becomes 0).  
And surprisingly, the level of enemies and shop items (not inventory) increases! (See each data page for details).  
  
Furthermore, the maximum level for allies also increases, and skills level up once a certain LV is reached.  
However, some skill levels, such as "Restore", will always be the same as the enemy's level.  
  
● Max Level  
Max Level = Enemy Level (Number of Playthroughs) × 100  
  
*Enemy growth is greater than ally growth.  
In other words, the more you clear, the higher the difficulty.  
  

## How to Lower Level

You can lower the enemy level from the menu screen by going to "Environment" -> "Enemy Level".  
Lowering the enemy level will also lower the level of shop items and the maximum level for allies.  
  
However, once you lower the level, it will not revert until you clear that playthrough, so be careful.  
It's a bit complicated, but if you clear the game with a lowered level, it will not advance to the next level in sequence; instead, it will advance to the next level beyond the highest level you've cleared in the past.  
  
For example, let's say you're currently on your 3rd playthrough (enemy level = 3).  
You decide you want to go back to the 1st playthrough and lower the enemy level to 1.  
Then, you clear that level 1.  
The level will return to 3 (not the next 2).
