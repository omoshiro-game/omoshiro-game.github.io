Sorry for the mess...  
But I think people who play this game are used to it (^^;  
  
After acquiring the Squid, you can go to various continents, and items may be found there.  
The obtainable items are as follows:  
  
・Moon Armor  
・Robe of Memories  
・????  
(I won't reveal it here, as I think it's better if you don't get it without hints. If you want to know, scroll down a lot ↓)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
"????" refers to "Legendary Armor," the strongest defense in this game.  
Answering the quizzes of the Quiz Kings appearing in various places will give you hints about its location.  
  
And, as for how to get it, you can obtain it by examining (pressing the action key) near the can east of "Warrior's Village."  
You cannot enter from "Warrior's Village"; you must go there by riding the Squid.
