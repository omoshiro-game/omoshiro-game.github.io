## "Legend of Yashiyu 2" Item Data

Prices are purchase prices (though some rare items aren't sold...), and selling prices are 75% of this.  
The single Kanji character at the beginning of each item name indicates the item category. (※道...Consumable item, 他...Other equipment)  
  
In this game, even if you **forget to pick up a rare item, it's absolutely impossible to miss it permanently!** (Actually, this was one of the reasons the administrator decided to make an RPG.)  
"Rare item" here refers to "items not sold in shops."  
For rare items, the acquisition method is listed in the notes.
